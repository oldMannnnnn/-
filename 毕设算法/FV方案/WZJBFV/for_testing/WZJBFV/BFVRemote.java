 * The {@link #dispose} method <b>must</b> be called on a <code>BFVRemote</code> instance 
 * when it is no longer needed to ensure that native resources allocated by this class 
 * are properly freed, and the server-side proxy is unexported.  (Failure to call dispose 
 * may result in server-side threads not being properly shut down, which often appears as 
 * a hang.)  
 *
 * This interface is designed to be used together with 
 * <code>com.mathworks.toolbox.javabuilder.remoting.RemoteProxy</code> to automatically 
 * generate RMI server proxy objects for instances of WZJBFV.BFV.
